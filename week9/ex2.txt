We can get increase in Hit/Miss ratio by accessing pages that are already was accessed recently.

For example, consider M unique pages and N page frames.
To minimize misses, we need to take groups of N unique pages, access them as much as we want, and then continue with next group.
In than idealize case, we will get only M misses to load each page in memory only once.

In extreme case, if we access same page N times, we will get only 1 page miss at the beginning and
N - 1 page hits, so maximal ratio we can get for N pages is N - 1.


To get decrease in ratio, we can access new pages each tick or access page we accessed long time ago
(so it no longer be present in table because it was replaced with other recently accessed pages)

For example, consider N+1 unique pages [1,2,3 ... ,N,N+1] and N page frames.
We can access pages in such order: 1, 2 ... N, N+1, 1, 2 ... N, N+1, 1, 2 ...
In that case, we will get only misses, because at first we will fill page table with [1,2,3 ... ,N]
N+1 will replace 1, 1 will replace 2 and so on. The cycle repeats, and we will never get a hit.

In extreme case, if we access new unique page every tick, we get only misses and ratio well be zero.
