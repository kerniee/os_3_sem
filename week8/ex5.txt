Virtual address points to virtual memory, which is a virtual main memory of machine.
Programs work with virtual addresses, and they have range of virtual address space available to them.

Physical address refers to real address on a RAM,
so internally computer translates virtual addresses to physical ones and make requests to disk.
Mapping between physical and virtual address is dynamic and usually made using idea of pages.
